README draft 2013-12-27-1045 GMT ... temporary document (cw)

Welcome to Diosix
-----------------

Once upon a time, I wrote a natty little fully fledged SMP microkernel
with a minimal userspace stack that included a virtual filesystem and
PCI manager, plus keyboard, video, ATA and network drivers. It worked,
albeit on 32-bit legacy i486-compatible systems and a 32-bit
ARMv4-compatible board. Yes, it worked, but it wasn't ready for 64-bit
nor was it optimised: I wanted a fast, secure 64-bit hot-lockless
microkernel that could be regression tested and tuned depending on
the userland software above it.

So now's the time to go back to the drawing board and make a proper
reliable operating system backed by a rewritten microkernel that can
be fully tested and is safe across 64-bit and 32-bit systems, whether
they are x86 or ARM. Hopefully it won't be a complete rewrite from
scratch, as I'll be bringing good code from the old project across,
but the architecture will change.

Eventually, the project will evolve into a distributed system but to
what end I've not decided. Maybe someone can suggest an application :-)

So that's why there is a lack of source code right now: I'm writing
it all again, but better, cleaner and with unit testing in mind.

Why share it?
-------------

I've made this available under an open-source licence for other people
to do what the will with it and potentially contribute to it.

I don't intend to write an entire OS from scratch - ideally, I want to
work on the microkernel and develop the distributed system processes,
and use existing drivers, libraries and applications from other
open-source projects on top.

The main goal is to have fun and learn something new.
