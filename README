Welcome to diosix, the tiny hardworking microkernel
---------------------------------------------------

Diosix is an experimental, lightweight and scalable microkernel
operating system for multiprocessor x86-64, ARM32 and ARM64 systems.
It's written in a mix of assembler and Rust, and some Perl and GNU
make to glue it together. The focus is security, isolation of
processes, and as minimal overhead as possible.

I want the project to evolve into a distributed system but to what
end I've not decided. Maybe someone can suggest an application :-)

Why share it?
-------------
I've made this available under an open-source licence for other
people to do what they will with it and potentially contribute to
it. I don't intend to write an entire OS from scratch - ideally,
I want to work on the microkernel and develop the distributed
system processes, and use existing drivers, libraries and
applications from other open-source projects on top.

The main goal is to have fun and learn something new.
